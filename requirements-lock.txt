# This file pins exact versions with integrity hashes to protect
# against supply chain attacks. Use for production deployments:
#   pip install --require-hashes -r requirements-lock.txt
#
# To regenerate after a dependency update:
#   pip download <pkg>==<ver> -d /tmp/hashes --no-deps
#   pip hash /tmp/hashes/<pkg>-<ver>-*.whl
